# Hello-World
This is the place of my ideas, plans and activities.
I'm not new to programming, but i'm new to Github. I'm building a brand new, expert portfolio.
I'm gathering my ideas, recent and future plans. 
In addition to getting more into the technology and programming world.

P.S: Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
